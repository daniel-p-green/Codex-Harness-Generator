# Getting Started

Open Codex in this project and ask for a small verified task. This
harness expects the assistant to inspect files before editing, avoid secrets, and
verify work with the narrowest meaningful check.

## First Checks

1. Run `/health-check` to verify the harness structure.
2. Ask Codex to map engine, scenes, scripts, assets, and build commands.
3. Ask for one small gameplay or tooling change.
4. Ask the reviewer to inspect build risk and playtest notes.

The permission profile allows workspace edits while denying secrets, tokens,
credentials, private keys, and `.env` files.

You can also run the local smoke check without the generator repo:

```bash
python scripts/check-harness.py
```
