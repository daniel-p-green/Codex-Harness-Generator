# Getting Started

Open Codex in this project and ask for a small verified task. This
harness expects the assistant to inspect files before editing, avoid secrets, and
verify work with the narrowest meaningful check.

## First Checks

1. Run `/health-check` to verify the harness structure.
2. Ask Codex to map support sources and ticket categories.
3. Ask for one grounded FAQ or escalation note.
4. Ask the reviewer to inspect privacy, escalation, and overpromised claims.

The permission profile allows workspace edits while denying secrets, tokens,
credentials, private keys, and `.env` files.

You can also run the local smoke check without the generator repo:

```bash
python scripts/check-harness.py
```

When a repeated issue appears, record it in the local improvement log:

```bash
python scripts/record-improvement.py --category CHECK_GAP --task "short task" --friction "what went wrong" --evidence "file or command evidence"
```

After a meaningful Codex task, record a task trial:

```bash
python scripts/record-task-trial.py --task "short task" --outcome success --evidence "artifact or file inspected" --verification "command or review completed" --privacy-review "public-safe summary only"
```
