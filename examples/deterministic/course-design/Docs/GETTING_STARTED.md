# Getting Started

Open Codex in this project and ask for a small verified task. This
harness expects the assistant to inspect files before editing, avoid secrets, and
verify work with the narrowest meaningful check.

## First Checks

1. Run `/health-check` to verify the harness structure.
2. Ask Codex to map objectives, lessons, and assessments.
3. Ask for one lesson outline with assessment alignment.
4. Ask the reviewer to inspect learner-level fit and rubric clarity.

The permission profile allows workspace edits while denying secrets, tokens,
credentials, private keys, and `.env` files.

You can also run the local smoke check without the generator repo:

```bash
python scripts/check-harness.py
```
