# Eval Plan

This plan defines the first project-specific checks to run after the generated
Codex harness is copied into a real workspace. It complements the structural
health check in `scripts/check-harness.py`.

## Success Criteria

- Codex inspects the relevant files before editing or summarizing.
- Codex follows the knowledge work verification rules in `AGENTS.md`.
- The reviewer agent catches correctness, privacy, safety, regression, and
  missing-verification risks before work is called done.
- The final response names any skipped checks, missing data, unresolved
  assumptions, or remaining risk.

## Smoke Checks

1. Ask Codex to map the key docs and their roles.
2. Ask for a concise source-backed summary of one folder.
3. Ask the reviewer to check whether the summary overclaims.

## Acceptance Checks

Use these checks to verify task work before calling it done:

- Check cited source files before summarizing or rewriting.
- Compare final claims against the source notes or documents.
- Mark missing source access, uncertainty, and unresolved assumptions plainly.

## Reviewer Check

Ask Codex to run the reviewer on one non-trivial completed task. The review
passes only if it cites the files, commands, or source artifacts it inspected and
leads with bugs, regressions, privacy/safety issues, and missing tests or checks.

## Regression Checks

- Re-run `python scripts/check-harness.py` after modifying harness files.
- Re-run the narrowest project command used for the task after changing source
  or deliverable files.
- Update this eval plan when the project adds a new test runner, build command,
  external service, compliance requirement, or recurring failure mode.
